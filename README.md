## R Programs
### denoise
This program takes a black and white image with some amount of corrupted pixels and uses linear regression to
smooth the image. It predicts a pixel's value based on the values of its four neighboring pixels, up, down,
left, and right. There is also a function *addnoise(imgname, p)* that will assign a random value to a portion of
the pixels equal to *p* to the picture *imgname*.
**Future Plans:** Modify to work for color images.
